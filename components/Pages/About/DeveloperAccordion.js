            I&apos;m currently a student at Florida Gulf Coast University
            finishing up my Software Engineering degree. I was born and raised
            in Southwest Florida, and I live in Naples. Previously I was apart
            of my family business for about 8 years, helping operate one of
            largest watersports companies in the country! I was responsible for
            our Ritz Carlton location in Naples, Florida.

            My name is Devin Arena, and I&apos;m currently a student and software
            engineer based in Naples, Florida. I currently attend Florida Gulf
            Coast University pursuing a Bachelor&apos;s of Science in Software
            Engineering. I found my love for programming early, at the age of 9.
            Ever since, I&apos;ve enjoyed designing and building websites, apps, and
            games. Creating useful software and enjoyable games are some of my
            favorite hobbies.
